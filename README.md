## Project Architecture and Related details

Specifics                 | Details
--------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------
| Architecture - MVVM-C   | Used RxSwift to bind View and ViewModel. Coodinator are responsible for navigation flow
| Networking - Alamofire  | `Network` folder -<br/>- `Network\HTTPService.swift` <br/>- `Network\APIProtocols` folder - All the protocols are implemented in `HTTPService.swift` <br/>
| Base classes            | `BaseClassesAndGenerics` folder - All the base & generic classes reside within this folder. All the other classes are inherited from the classes which are within this folder.
| Models                  | `Models` folder - All the models used by the app reside within this folder. Almost all the models which are consumed by the Network Services are extending `BaseModel` class.
| Views                   | `Views` folder - All the UI elements reside within this folder. (Storyboards, ViewControllers, ViewModels, Common Reusable components, TableView Cells)
| App Config         	    | Used a simple Singleton class to keep the configuration parameters. All the values that are used by AppConfig are stored in `Configuration.plist`
